We reproduced the algorithm mentioned in the paper [2009, ICDM] Detection and Characterization of Anomalies in Multivariate Time Series.pdf. The main idea of the algorithm is to construct an NxN similarity matrix through the relationship between data points, and Matrix alignment is performed by linear transformation to associate the relationship between the multivariate variables. The final output of the model is a one-dimensional association vector. The lower the value, the less relevant and abnormal the other data points.
